# My Portfolio  

Hi, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹  

This repository contains the start of my personal portfolio as I learn web development.  
Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering at Multimedia University of Kenya and exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Here Iâ€™ll be adding my projects, practice code, and notes as I grow my skills.

### Goals
- Build responsive websites  
- Learn modern front-end tools like React and Tailwind CSS  
- Create a personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages  

Stay tuned â€” this is just the beginning ðŸš€
